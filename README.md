# GAWP

Gawp is a Gulp Augmented WordPress starter theme.
It uses a modified version of underscores and adds a Gulp build process.
The theme's source files and build files are kept seperate.

The Gulp build process is based on a [tutorial by Craig Buckler](https://www.sitepoint.com/fast-gulp-wordpress-theme-development-workflow/), updated for Gulp 4.

Gawp compiles css from SASS and PostCss, and bundles JavaScript.
Itâ€™s quite minimalist, with no transpiling or linting of JavaScript.
It does however minify the bundled JS and compiled CSS.
