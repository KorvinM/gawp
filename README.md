# GAWP

Gawp is a Gulp Augmented WordPress starter theme.
It uses a modified version of underscores and adds a Gulp build process.
The theme's source files and build files are kept seperate.

The Gulp build process is based on a [tutorial by Craig Buckler](https://www.sitepoint.com/fast-gulp-wordpress-theme-development-workflow/), updated for Gulp 4.

Gawp compiles css from SASS and PostCss, and bundles JavaScript, minifying those
assets. Itâ€™s quite minimalist, with no transpiling or linting.

## How To Use

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repo
1. Rename gulpfile.js/config-sample.js to gulpfile.js/config.js
1. Run `npm install`

### Usage
* Gawp is designed to sit outside the public directory of your WordPress environment
* Edit your gulpfile.js/config.js file, where indicated, to specify:
  * your build path: it should be a new directory within wp-content/themes/
  * your WordPress site url
  * your theme name NB: If you use 'Gawp' or 'gawp' in your php files, they will be replaced by your theme name or slug, and if you use 'Gawp' anywhere in your scss files, it too will be replaced by your theme name.
* edit src/style.scss as appropriate.
* Gulp tasks are defined in gulpfile.js/index.js, which is defined as the entry point for node purposes.
  * `gulp build` builds the theme into the build directory specified
  * `gulp clean` deletes the build directory.
  * `gulp watch` runs browsersync as a proxy to the WordPress url specified.
  * `gulp` runs the default task: `clean`, `build`, and `watch` in series.
