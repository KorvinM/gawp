Gawp is a Gulp Augmented WordPress starter theme.
It uses a modified version of underscores and adds a Gulp build process.
The theme's source files and build files are kept seperate.

The Gulp build process is based on a tutorial by Craig Buckler, updated for Gulp 4. It compiles css from SASS and PostCss, and bundles JavaScript. Itâ€™s quite minimalist, with no transpiling, linting, or HTML minification. It does however minify the bundled JS and compiled CSS.
