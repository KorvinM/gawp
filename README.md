# GAWP

Gawp is a Gulp Augmented WordPress starter theme.
It uses a modified version of underscores and adds a Gulp build process.
The theme's source files and build files are kept seperate.

The Gulp build process is based on a [tutorial by Craig Buckler](https://www.sitepoint.com/fast-gulp-wordpress-theme-development-workflow/), updated for Gulp 4.

Gawp compiles css from SASS and PostCss, and bundles JavaScript.
Itâ€™s quite minimalist, with no transpiling or linting of JavaScript.
It does however minify the bundled JS and compiled CSS.

## How To Use

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repo
1. Rename gulpfile.js/config-sample.js to gulpfile.js/config.js
1. Run `npm install`

### Usage
* Gawp is intended to sit outside the public directory of your WordPress environment
* Edit your gulpfile.js/config.js file to specify:
  * your build path: it should be a new directory within wp-content/themes/
  * your WordPress url
* Gulp tasks are defined in gulpfile.js/index.js
  * `gulp build` builds the theme into the build directory specified
  * `gulp clean` will delete the build directory.
  * `gulp watch` will run browsersync as a proxy to the WordPress url specified.
  * `gulp` runs the default task, which runs `clean`, `build`, and `watch` in series.
